🌻 hi there!! i'm taz, but you may call me lucas, luce, lottie, etc. :) this is my github account for pony town! [please be sure to check out my website](https://thegreenroom.neocities.org/), you can sign my guestbook there! it's located in the homepage :) best seen on desktop! ᶻ 𝗓 𐰁 i may be a coder myself yes but... don't expect me to use my github for anything else

if you don't wanna look through my page though (or are on mobile) you can check my guestbook [here](https://users3.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g36-39308-97) instead!

i'm a major battat kinnie (i just found this out recently and now i'm making it my entire personality) and i like to make ocs and oc x canon.
yes, i'm the guy who made cupio. i usually hang around the UT/DR area, and i'm mostly a DELTARUNE fan so please don't expect me to talk much about UNDERTALE as much!
i do NOT have a dni, i either block freely or ignore. i just don't really care writing for most of this stuff to be honest. other than that, usual dni criteria is a block lol

✦ **I'M A TENNA YUMESHIPPER** i like tenna a WHOLE LOT. even if i'm not open about it here i may or may not talk about this sometimes so be warned, ESPECIALLY if you're non-sharing. i am a sharing tenna yume though! <3

✦ this also also means i don't usually do Serious ship rps with like... other tenna ships. i'm sharing i know but still! not because i hate them or anything tho.

✦ i'm autistic, please be patient with me <:) i'm rather slow and i don't really recognize a lot of social cues. please be sure to use tone tags around me!

✦ i'm okay with c+h and i do so often! howEVER please know that i'm only comfy with it when i've talked to you already. please don't do it at random. Thank You!!!

✦ i also have social anxiety, so i may be more closed off than others. i also have paranoia so i can't really disclose a lot of info sometimes haha

✦ despite that though, i'm very social!!! i like talking to people and i don't mind getting interacted w/ so long as you're not being weird and if you ask first. :)

**✦ ABOUT ME ✦**
