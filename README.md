yes, i'm the guy who made cupio. i usually hang around the UT/DR area, and i'm mostly a DELTARUNE fan so please don't expect me to talk much about UNDERTALE as much!
i do NOT have a dni, i either block freely or ignore. i just don't really care writing for most of this stuff to be honest. other than that, usual dni criteria is a block lol
